# Reciprocity in Directed Hypergraphs: Measures, Findings, and Generators

We provide source code for Reciprocity in Directed Hypergraphs: Measures, Findings, and Generators, which has been submitted to ICDM 22.  

In this work, we
- Propose a novel hypergraph reciprocity measure, ***HyperRec***.
- Propose an efficient searching algorithm for ***HyperRec***, a ***Ferret***.
- Discover real-world hypergraph's reciprocal pattern on 11 datasets.
- Propose an intuitive reciprocity-preserving hypergraph generator, ***ReDi***, which can captures the reciprocal patterns of real world hypergraphs.

Here, we provide source does for entire process. 

(1) Calculating proposed reciprocity ***HyperRec*** of the real-world hypergraphs.  
(2) Generating synthetic hypergraphs by using proposed hypergraph generator ***ReDi***, or null hypergraphs & baseline hypergraphs (see main paper for detail).  
(3) Reproducing all figures in the paper.
