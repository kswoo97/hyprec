# Reciprocity in Directed Hypergraphs: Measures, Findings, and Generators

We provide source code for Reciprocity in Directed Hypergraphs: Measures, Findings, and Generators, which has been submitted to ICDM 22.  

In this work, we
- Propopse a novel hypergraph reciprocity measure, ***HyperRec***.
- Propose an efficient searching algorithm for ***HyperRec***, a ***Ferret***.
- Discover real-world hypergraph's reciprocal pattern on 11 datasets.
- 


(1) Calculating proposed reciprocity ***HyperRec*** of the real world hypergraph  
(2) Generating synthetic hypergraphs by using proposed hypergraph generator ***ReDi***.  
(3) Reproducing all tables and figures in the paper.    

(1) Calculating proposed reciprocity ***HyperRec*** of the real world hypergraph
